Omgevingsbeleid API was originally created in early 2018 in order to meet the requirements
given by the new 'Omgevingswet' from the dutch national government.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who laid the groundwork, have submitted patches, reported bugs, added
translations, helped answer questions, and generally made Omgevingsbeleid API that much
better:

    Swen Mulderij <swenmulderij@gmail.com>
    Ingmar Emons <i.emons@pzh.nl>
    Jason Kalmijn <Jason.kalmijn@effectivechanges.com>
    Erik Verhaar <e.verhaar@pzh.nl>
    

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    The Provincie Zuid Holland who initiated the project.

    The Foundation for Public Code who helped us get this software open source and maintainable.

    All our testers, early users and fans.
